# File Based Data Logger

The focus of this project is to develop a file-based data logger software that can simulate sensor data and then manipulate, recording, and then organizing the data into a usable format like CSV (Comma Seperated Values).

This software will provide the following features:
- Generating sensor data
- Configurable sampling rates
- Recording sensor data
- Accurate timestamping
- Smart file naming

This software would be used by organizations that may require data collection using sensors such as but not limited to:
- Weather stations
- Seismic monitoring
- Manufacturing
- Agriculture

# User Stories
- As a user, I wish to pause and resume data collection to control. 
- As a user, I want timestamped files for easy data identification.
- As a test engineer, I wish to be able to insert anomalies to test the systems robustness.
- As a data analyst, I wish to be able to save data to CSV files for statistical analysis.
- As a system integrator, I wish to be able to export data as JSON files for API integration.
- As a user, I wish to load previous data for analysis.
- As a data analyist, I wish to be able to view sample statistics.
